        A car or an automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.
        Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.

        French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born-Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[4] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.

            Etymology
        </p>
    </h2>
    <p align="justify">
        The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled cart", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot". It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon."Motor car", attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English. "Autocar", a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning "self-propelled car", is now considered archaic."Horseless carriage" is attested from 1895. "Automobile", a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek autós (αὐτός) "self" and Latin mobilis "movable", entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.
        It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America,where the abbreviated form "auto" commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like "auto industry" and "auto mechanic".

        From the outset I should say that I believe electric personal transportation vehicles will be mostly all-electric by 2050, by which time (we hope…) most electricity being fed into the national grid will be generated by renewable means and so EVs won’t simply be moving pollution from one place to another and not actually providing any climate benefit whatsoever.<br>I also believe that engineers and materials scientists will continue to develop battery technologies so as to reduce dependency on very scarce rare Earth metals and simultaneously improve storage capacity while reducing recharge times. Moreover, we’re seeing new discoveries of rare Earth metals in stable nations like Australia, Sweden, Norway, and elsewhere, so shortages won’t be a problem even when most new cars and SUVs sold are EVs.

        I don’t think electric trucks will replace Macks and Peterbilts because the economics are never going to work and the climate benefit simply isn’t worth the cost — not even close. Likewise electric planes are an astonishingly stupid idea and a lot of people will lose a lot of money investing in companies that attempt to deliver such a ludicrously inefficient and meaningless product. If most of the economy goes to renewables, it simply won’t matter if the aviation industry runs on kerosene. We don’t need to eliminate all CO2 emissions in order to “save the planet” (which is a risible concept anyway). We just need to cut back massively so we stop acidifying the oceans and thereby risking the food chain and the supply of 67% of the Earth’s oxygen. What I am deeply skeptical about, however, is developing the infrastructure necessary to charge all these planned vehicles
